<h1>Rusty Ice</h1>

WIP game set in the arctic on an alien planet.

To run "./gradlew desktop:run"
To build jar "./gradlew desktop:dist"
Assets can packet with "./gradlew tools:packassets" (should be changed)

Much of the game will take place in an underground science facility where an unstable ai is producing half cyborg zombie with ever
increasing intelligence and simple tool use.

The facility is made up of models each with a different purpose, medical, power-plant, storage depot, ect...

These facilities will be designed ahead of time using a level editor.
